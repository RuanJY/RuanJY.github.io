# Projects
### 2D lidar SLAM based on Gaussian Process, 11/2018~10/2019. 
We proposed a novel 2D lidar SLAM using Gaussian Process (GP), a continuous representation with the ability to make inference with uncertainty, to model the structures in the environment. The method outperforms a classical method, Gmapping, in both accuracy and efficiency.

### 3D lidar SLAM based on Gaussian Process, 06/2019~current.
In more complex 3D scenarios, the state estimation of GP-SLAM was redesigned and the training process of GP was accelerated with the insight of such an interpolation-based registration method. A two-thread framework was also designed for large-scale 3D mapping tasks. With higher efficiency and robustness with the sparse point cloud, our system produces a consistent map and outperforms A-LOAM and Lego-LOAM when working with light-weight lidar sensors.

### Various MAVs 
Target on overcoming different shortcomings of MAV, various MAV were built. Multicoper with 5G module for inspection, portable fix-wing drones for detecting, transportation VTOL vehicles, aeromodelling glider, solar-powered fix-wing UAV without energy storing device.
