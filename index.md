# Projects
### 2D lidar SLAM based on Gaussian Process, 11/2018~current. 
We proposed a novel 2D lidar SLAM using Gaussian Process (GP), a continuous representation with the ability to make inference with uncertainty, to model the structures in the environment. I enhanced the efficiency of the method more than 10 times. I implemented it in C++ and evaluated the performance in a mobile robot based on ROS. Finally, the method outperforms a classical method, Gmapping, in both accuracy and efficiency.

### 3D lidar SLAM based on Gaussian Process, 06/2019~current.
Based on the 2D GP-SLAM, I extended it to more complex 3D scenarios. To do so, the state estimation was redesigned and the training process of GP was accelerated with the insight of such an interpolation-based registration method. A two-thread framework was also designed for large-scale 3D mapping tasks. With higher efficiency and robustness with the sparse point cloud, our system produces a consistent map and outperforms A-LOAM and Lego-LOAM when working with light-weight lidar sensors.

### 5G+UAV for aerial power line inspection, 07/2020~current.
I equipped the UAV with a 5G module and establish the communication between UAV and ground station via SA network and MAVLink protocol, which enables remote power line inspection. We achieved real-time FHD video transformation and control with a latency around 100ms.

### China Aeromodelling Design Challenge, 2014, 2015, 2016.
I served as the captain of the aeromodelling team of Zhejiang University and work with more than 20 members from different majors to compete in this challenge. For several years, we attended various projects including portable fix-wing drones for detecting, transportation VTOL vehicles, aeromodelling glider, and achieved several awards including the national champion.

### “Zhongkong Cup” Robot competition of Zhejiang University, 10/2015~05/2016.
We built an autonomous mobile robot to scramble cubes against other teams following certain strategies automatically. As the leader, I considered mobility as the priority and design compact graspers as well as accurate motion control. Finally, our robot became one of the most efficient ones on the ground.
### Solar-powered fix-wing UAV, 01~08/2016.
We developed a solar-powered fix-wing UAV in the Science and technology innovation activity plan for college students in the Zhejiang province project. I designed the structure meticulously with light materials for high strength. Finally, our UAV, with a 3 m wingspan and a weight less than 3 kg, success to flight without any energy storing device. 

### Student Research Training Program in Zhejiang University, 03/2015~06/2016.
To test the feasibility of using UAV for delivery, I designed a light-weight grasper with a wide workspace in a helicopter UAV for remote manipulation with my teammates. The project was chosen as an outstanding project in the College.
